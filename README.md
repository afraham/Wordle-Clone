# Wordle-Clone 🎮
A Wordle Clone made from HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, where words are generated as a dictionary of words from an endpoint accessed by a API key.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **HTML:** Used for structuring the game interface and elements, including the header with the title, hint and dark-mode option, a 4x4 gameboard, the side-bar of instructions, the hint and failure message bottom bar, and the winning screen.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript:** Used to implement the game logic, user interactions, and API communication. (No external libraries were used)
- **API:** Integrated an external dictionary API to fetch valid words for the game.
